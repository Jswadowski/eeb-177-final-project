I plan on using the data from a research study we completed in our Exercise Physiology lab involving Triathletes. During the course of this project, I hope to take the heart rates acquired for all of the subjects (remotely collected ~3 seconds) during their training sessions (over an 8 week collection period) and create threshold-based ranges in accordance with their metabolic and ventilatory thresholds that were collected during an initial, mid-study and final VO2 Max test. Data manipulation will include sorting, graphical representation and statistical analysis.
